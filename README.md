# Daily Coding Challenge

I am always interested in working to solve fun problems. I also know there are
a hundred different ways to solve a single problem. So, for this
[Hacktoberfest][1] I wanted to make a way for beginners and advanced
programmers alike to have an easy way to contribute to open source while
flexing their coding muscles.

# Process
Each day I will submit one coding challenge. I will accept answers to that
challenge in any language. The hope is that there will be a couple different
ways to answer any one challenge in a single language and I'd like to see those
variations.

If I can't think of a problem that seems interesting or fun then I will use one
distributed by [DailyCodingProblem.com][2] or pull one from [Project Euler][3]
